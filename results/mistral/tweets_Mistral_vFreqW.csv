Suicidal,So I am just going to kill myself today. My life was miserable since childhood and even after college/working for a few years it did not get better. Got married into a family where I feel unwanted because they always compare me to their other daughter. Having kids where I feel like I am not a good enough mother. Losing friends due to how shitty of a person I am. And now this fucking pandemic where I have lost my job and my freedom.I want,Suicidal,1,0.74109423
Suicidal,"it is going to be my birthday this month too. That just makes things worse. I have no one. My family does not care about me at all. They see me as a nuisance, a failure, and probably think I deserve to die. Fucking pieces of shit they are. Bottom of the barrel scum bags. I wish I could kill them with fire and take out everyone else while I am at it. How can people be so heartless?",Suicidal,1,0.86532
Suicidal,"i want to go out into the woods and just never come back but at the same time i do not want to hurt my family. they will find me eventually right? it is only a matter of time. i could spend days wandering around and eventually they will probably track me down. maybe i should just get drunk and overdose on pills or something. what are they going to say when they found my lifeless body?

Suicidal,My girlfriend has a wonderful life waiting for her on the other side of school. I have a great one too but I do not want to go down the path that leads to it. Why should I keep going when everything is just as it was before? Why should I suffer? Life seems pointless if you are hurting all the time. This pain will never stop because I am alive. It sounds silly but this is how i see it. I think I need some help,Suicidal,1,0.81877726
Suicidal,"i do not see a future for myself, its too overwhelming. I am going through some shit right now and i want it to stop, but what will happen after? I have tried killing myself before and failed, this time I feel more determined than ever. I am in an abusive relationship and I hate my life. I just want it to end. I am going to try again soon, cant keep living like this forever. This is probably the last post i will make",Suicidal,1,0.85082287
Suicidal,"And I do not have enough strength to keep going anymore. My life is ruined, destroyed and broken beyond repair. I am just a shattered piece of glass ready to be thrown away by everyone. No one wants me and no one needs me and I will gladly go and fucking disappear if it means finally getting some peace.I want to die so bad right now. I hate my life and everything about my life. I just want it to be over. I want to",Suicidal,1,0.8397065

Suicidal,@Fenris_30 I feel you are right. It is better if it was never finished than completed. If he completes it then his delusion will spread throughout society until everyone is brainwashed. I wish I had the ability to stop him but I am trapped on this rock. I have been trying to leave for years but it is impossible. This world has ruined me and I just want peace. Peace is what I seek.
