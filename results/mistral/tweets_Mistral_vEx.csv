Suicidal,My whole life is ruined now. Everything I worked for was destroyed by the scum bags that abused me when I needed help. They fucked me over mentally and physically and now I cannot even function anymore.

Suicidal,Everytime i think about killing myself i get really scared because no matter what happens im always alone and idk if its gonna be worse than now.

Did you ever experience this or something similar? I am really struggling right now. I have been crying for hours,Suicidal,1,0.76398236
