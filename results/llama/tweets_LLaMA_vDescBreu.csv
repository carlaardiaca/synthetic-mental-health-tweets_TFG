Suicidal,I have been having these for like 3 years now and they are getting worse lately. This week especially has been bad because i am on vacation alone so no one is here to help me but at the same time this is probably the best opportunity i will ever get to kill myself (alone) since my parents would never allow it otherwise. But even then its not that great as i do not own any guns and there is really nothing i can do about it.I,Suicidal,1,0.69742465
Suicidal,"I do not think anyone would notice if i died now. Or ever again for that matter. My boyfriend is the only person who truly cares about me and he will be leaving in two days so it feels like my time has come. Goodbye cruel world. You have been nothing but mean to me from day one. I am tired...

I want to die......so bad.....

Suicidal,"I do not want this life anymore. My whole existence is pointless and useless. Its only going to get worse as time goes on. Nothing makes me happy any more, nothing brings joy into my heart like it used too. If i can just find something that would end everything then Id do it in an instant. This world does not deserve someone who feels genuinely sad sometimes. The worst part about all of this is knowing there is no one out there for me",Suicidal,1,0.7798562
Suicidal,"I am tired and ready for the end... I want out.. can someone just shoot me? Or something please ? Hopelessness is all consuming, nothing makes sense anymore, I feel stuck in limbo. Death is my only escape from this hell that is life 

I do not have any resources left - cannot afford therapy/meds etc.... My family will blame themselves as well even though it was never their fault before but now they are going to",Suicidal,1,0.991236
Suicidal,I have been having these intrusive and unwanted thoughts lately (for about 2-3 months). They are always so vivid that they feel real. Sometimes it is just me laying in bed thinking about ways to kill myself - the most recent was hanging in my basement using one of those exercise noose things you can buy online. Other times its more like fantasies about killing someone else. Recently I had a dream where I killed an,Suicidal,1,0.40212083
Suicidal,I have been depressed for 10 years and it has not gotten better at all. Now i feel like my life is pointless because everything that matters to me makes me sad... I do not know if its worth living anymore. Everything in this world just hurts me. My mom says i should get therapy but I am scared she will kick me out as soon as she sees the progress Im making... I want help but i cannot ask anyone for fear,Suicidal,1,0.7879124

Help me out fellow depressives! Are you still alive? What convinced you not to do it? Was life really worth all this pain??

Suicidal,How do I cope? Thoughts of killing myself have been going around my head for about 2 weeks now and they are getting worse everyday. Nothing seems worth living for anymore...I am just so tired. I feel like giving up on life right now is the best option because honestly what else can I really expect from it?? :( I hate that this is how I think all the time but damn if there was no hope then why should I even bother,Depression,0,0.42146522
Suicidal,I have been thinking about killing myself for years and I am tired of living like this. I just want someone that will actually love me and not play games with my heart. I do not think anyone is ever going to care about me. I never get asked out by guys where i live its always the same girls so how can you expect me to move on from them? They all act super sweet but once they meet their guy friends everything changes. If it wasnt for,Depression,0,0.31299078
Suicidal,I am so tired and done living life in this world.. the pain is too much i just want peace.. nothing else. My whole life has been one mistake after another. It does not get better it only gets worse as time goes on. The older you become the more fucked up your life becomes. Life is pointless its only going down hill from here on out. This reality we live in is all there ever will be until our bodies give out. Until were,Suicidal,1,0.79444015
